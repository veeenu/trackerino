# Trackerino

## A privacy-first minimal web analytics tracker

Watch live at https://twitch.tv/johndisandonato

This is  a very simple web  service that tracks  impressions to web pages  via a
tracker script, and shows them on a dedicated dashboard. Design priorities:

- Minimal:   single  statically   linked  executable,   easy  to   deploy  both
  containerized and as an installed service
- Privacy  first: only  track as  little information  as possible  without using
  cookies and without identifying the user
- Fast: it should have as little overhead as possible for the visited webpage

## Live coding

I've decided to do a little experiment and  do all the coding live on Twitch and
then upload it to Youtube, in order to show what it looks like to take a project
from zero to production-ready (and evaluate myself in the process).
